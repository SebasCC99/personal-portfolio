          <p>
            Born in Venezuela, I moved to the US in 2019. Reading every time I
            could, I came across Ray Dalio and his book Principles. In it, Dalio
            talked about his approach to investing in the financial markets
            which sparked a fire in me to do the same! <br /><br />
            After mentoring and online research, I started my engineering
            journey with Python for its begineer friendly caractheristic. With
            the desire to get professional experience under my belt as soon as
            possible, I attended Galvanize's Hack Reactor's Full Stack Bootcamp,
            from which I graduated in october of 2021.

              experts, utilizing a vast network of local florists to deliver
              meaningful gifts of joy, strength, and love through handcrafted

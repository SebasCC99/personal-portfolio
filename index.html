          <p>
            Born in Venezuela, I moved to the US in 2019. Reading every time I
            could, I came across Ray Dalio and his book Principles. In it, Dalio
            talked about his approach to investing in the financial markets
            which sparked a fire in me to do the same! <br /><br />
            After mentoring and online research, I started my engineering
            journey with Python for its begineer friendly caractheristic. With
            the desire to get professional experience under my belt as soon as
            possible, I attended Galvanize's Hack Reactor's Full Stack Bootcamp,
            from which I graduated in october of 2021.

              At Net32 Inc since March 2023, as a Full Stack Engineer, I've led
              the enhancement of user interfaces and system performance through
              dynamic Next.js features and the migration of React pages. My work
              with Product Owners on a vendor performance dashboard
              significantly streamlined data access and improved the frontend
              experience for U.S. dentists. Focusing on backend improvements, I
              developed RESTful APIs and a Java backend using Spring Boot,
              ensuring the application's security and performance.

              As a Junior Front-end Engineer at FTD from January 2022 to
              February 2023, I enhanced our eCommerce UI, directly impacting
              sales and revenue through scalable software solutions. My
              responsibilities included developing Storybook components, writing
              Jest tests in line with Test-Driven Development practices, and
              managing A/B testing to optimize performance. This role allowed me
              to effectively address core business needs through close
              collaboration with Product Owners and stakeholders.

              In my role as a Software Engineer Immersive Resident at Galvanize
              Inc from October 2021 to January 2022, I mentored over 30 students
              in a comprehensive software engineering program focused on
              JavaScript. I guided them through complex concepts and debugging
              techniques, emphasizing coding best practices and Agile
              methodologies. My contribution was pivotal in fostering a
              comprehensive understanding of software development among
              students.
